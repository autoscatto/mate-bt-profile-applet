# mate-bt-profile-applet
Simple MATE panel applet that allows you to seamlessly switch between A2DP and HSP Bluetooth audio profiles for your connected device.
The switch can be set manually from the panel and is also sensitive to external events that change the device profile (e.g., via blueman-manager)
